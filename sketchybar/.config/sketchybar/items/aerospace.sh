# - TARGET_WORKSPACE: The ID of the workspace the window was moved to
# - FOCUSED_WORKSPACE: The ID of the workspace that is currently focused (where the window is moving from)

# This custom event (triggered in ~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml) fires when
# a workspace is moved to a different monitor.
# It will include two variables:
# - TARGET_MONITOR: The system ID of the monitor the workspace was moved to (NOT aerospace ID)
# - TARGET_WORKSPACE: The ID of the workspace that is being moved
